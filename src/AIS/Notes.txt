I created FTServer/src/AIS/ and added my code there.

I then modified FTServer/app.js:

  I added
    import ais from './src/AIS/aisstream.js'
  to ../../app.js

  I changed
    // Create a worker for each CPU
    for (let i = 0; i < cpuCount; i += 1) {
      cluster.fork();
    }
  to
    // Create a worker for each additional CPU
    for (let i = 1; i < cpuCount; i += 1) {
      cluster.fork();
    }

I don't know if that second change is important, but that's how I tested locally.
